# Task 5 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project is part of my Data Analyst Internship, focused on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **Titanic dataset** using Python.

## 📊 Project Overview
The goal of this task is to explore the Titanic dataset to uncover key insights and patterns about passengers' survival chances. The analysis includes:
- Data cleaning and handling missing values  
- Univariate and bivariate analysis  
- Correlation analysis and visualizations  
- Summary of insights and observations  

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 📂 Files Included
- `Titanic_EDA.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with complete EDA code and visualizations  
- `Titanic_EDA_Report.pdf` – PDF report summarizing findings and insights  
- `train.csv` – Dataset used for the analysis  

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Female passengers had a higher survival rate compared to males.  
- 1st class passengers were more likely to survive than those in 3rd class.  
- Higher fare values are associated with better survival chances.  
- Most passengers were male and from 3rd class.
